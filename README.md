What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

  The problem for this project was to create a code that allowed for a quick search and sort of a list of classes from ABCU. That included writing out pseudocode, doing runtime analysis, and then writing the code for the project.
  
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

  I looked at the codes that I had previously written throughout the course and found that a mix of vector sorting and binary tree searching to be the best and most efficient method to use for the problem at hand.
  
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

  I found that reading back through not only the supplied reading, but also looking back through the previously written codes for the assignments of the class really helped when trying to write certain parts of the overall code.
  
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

  It has definitely opened my eyes to the different data structures and has made me want to do more research into the other types of structures and their uses in the programming aspect of computer sciences.
  
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  
  I feel that I have tried to use the method and class classifications to be able to keep the maintainability and adaptability to standard, those have really helped. As far as readable I feel that I  use the right amount of whitespace as well as the appropriate commentation style.
